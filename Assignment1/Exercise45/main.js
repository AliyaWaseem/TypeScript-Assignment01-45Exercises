// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
// such as a color or an optional feature.
//  Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function storeInfo(manufacturer, modelName, ...extraOption) {
    const carInfo = Object.assign({ manufacturer,
        modelName }, Object.assign({}, ...extraOption));
    return carInfo;
}
let answer = storeInfo("Honda", "Civic", { "color": "blue" }, { "optional feature": ["Bulletproof", "Navigation"] });
