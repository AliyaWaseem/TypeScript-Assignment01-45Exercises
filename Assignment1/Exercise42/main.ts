//Exercise:42
//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by
// adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name.
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magician: string[] = [
  "Ricky Jay",
  "Derren Brown",
  "Harry Houdini",
  "David Blaine",
];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
  magicians.forEach((name) => {
    console.log(name);
  });
}

function make_great(magician: string[]) {
  for (let i = 0; i < magician.length; i++) {
    magician[i] = "The Great " + magician[i];
  }
}

make_great(magician);
